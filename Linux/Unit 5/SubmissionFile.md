### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
	tar xvvf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
	tar cvvWf Javaless_Doc.tar -exclude=TarDocs/Documents/Java TarDocs/

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
	tar tvvf Javaless_Doc.tar | grep Java

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

	tar czvvWf logs_backup_tar.gz --listed-incremental=snapshot.file --level=0 /var/log

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same with `tar`?

	The '-x' option is for extracting and the '-c' is for creating. Using both at the same time would be requesting conflicting activities.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:

	0 6 * * 3 tar czvvWf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:

	mkdir ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    [Your solution script contents here]

	# Free memory output to a free_mem.txt file
	free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

	# Disk usage output to a disk_usage.txt file
	du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

	# List open files to a open_list.txt file
	lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

	# Free disk space to a free_disk.txt file
	df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
	chmod 744 system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
	sudo ./system.sh
	cat ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt --> file should not be empty
	cat ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt --> file should not be empty
	cat ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt --> file should not be empty
	cat ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt --> file should not be empty

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:
	sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.weekly

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    [Your logrotate scheme edits here]

	/var/log/auth.log {
	weekly
	missingok
	rotate 7
	notifempty
	compress
	delaycompress
	}

   ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:
	systemctl status auditd

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
	num_logs = 7
	max_log_file = 35

    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
	## Rule for /etc/shadow: watch file (-w), monitor changes to write, read permission (-p wr), file attributes (a)
	-w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit

	## Rule for /etc/passwd: watch file (-w), monitor changes to write, read permission (-p wr), file attributes (a)
	-w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit

	## Rule for /var/log/auth.log: watch file (-w), monitor changes to write, read permission (-p wr), file attributes (a)
	-w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit

    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:
	systemctl restart auditd	

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:
	auditctl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report:
	sudo aureport

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:
	sudo aureport -m	

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:
	auditctl -w /var/log/cron -k cron_watch

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:
	auditctl -l

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution cron edits here]
    ```
